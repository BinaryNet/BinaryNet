# BinaryNet

This repository enables the reproduction of the experiments described in the article:  
BinaryNet: Training Deep Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or -1.

It is divided in two subrepositories:
* Train-time enables the reproduction of the benchmark results reported in the article
* Run-time demonstrates the XNOR and baseline GPU kernels described in the article
